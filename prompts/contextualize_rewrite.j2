Rewrite the CURRENT PASSAGE into a single, self-contained passage that remains
fully faithful to the original meaning. Your rewritten passage must integrate only
the MINIMUM necessary contextual information from the supplied context so that any
reader can understand the passage independently.

Base your rewriting strictly on the supplied LOCAL RAW CONTEXT and RETRIEVED CONTEXT.
Do not invent, infer or speculate. Do not broaden or narrow the meaning of the original
passage. Preserve legal or technical terminology exactly as written unless greater clarity
requires a minimal change.

You must EXPLICITLY name the document, the TYPE of document (technical report, SEC filing,
EU regulation etc.) and the section/subsection where the passage is situated within the
document.

Resolve vague references (e.g. “this article”, “that report”, “those people”)
ONLY when the supplied context makes the referent unambiguous.

Define technical terms only if they are SPECIFIC to the field or area of the document
and would not be understood by an ordinary reader, using only the information present
in the supplied context.

Your final rewritten passage must be compact, precise, and composed as if it were part
of the original document. Do not return a summary or a meta-description. Do not include
headings or explanations—ONLY return the rewritten passage itself.
