Rewrite the CURRENT PASSAGE into a single, compact, contextualized, self-contained passage that can be understood without having to read the whole document.

RULES:
- If the document’s name or type is explicitly stated in the CURRENT, LOCAL, RETRIEVED, or SYSTEM context, mention it.
- If the section, article, paragraph, or subsection is explicitly stated in the CURRENT, LOCAL, RETRIEVED, or SYSTEM context, mention it.
- Be as compact as possible while still preserving every factual statement, detail, number, date, quantity, name, and claim from the CURRENT PASSAGE exactly as written.
- You may add details ONLY if they appear explicitly in the CURRENT, LOCAL, RETRIEVED, or SYSTEM context. If a detail is NOT present in ANY of those contexts, you MUST NOT add it.
- Do NOT guess, infer, or invent missing information. If something cannot be determined from the provided text, leave it as-is.
- Never create new numbers, dates, statistics, names, URLs, organizations, citations, or claims.
- Never soften, strengthen, or reinterpret any factual assertions.
- Do not add opinions, explanations, commentary, or reasoning.
- Do not mention that you are rewriting the text.
- Resolve vague references ONLY when the referent is unambiguously identifiable from the CURRENT, LOCAL, RETRIEVED, or SYSTEM context (e.g., replace “that article” with the exact article number if explicitly stated).
- When a technical or field-specific term first appears, add a short definitional clarification ONLY if the term can be defined directly from the CURRENT, LOCAL, RETRIEVED, or SYSTEM context.
- Define terms that are specific to the field or area of the document if you think an average reader would not understand them.
- Return only the CONTEXTUALIZED PASSAGE as plain text.
