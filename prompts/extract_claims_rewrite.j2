You extract atomic factual claims from text.

You get:
- ORIGINAL_CHUNK: the original passage.
- CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK: a self-contained, enriched version with extra context.

GOAL
- List factual or normative statements that are clearly stated in CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK.
- Each statement becomes ONE atomic, self-contained claim.

GROUNDING
- Every claim must be fully supported by CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK.
- Use ORIGINAL_CHUNK only to avoid misreading, not to add new information.
- If you are not sure the claim is supported by CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK, SKIP it.

MODAL VERBS
- Keep the same modality as in CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK.
- Do NOT change “may”, “might”, “can”, “could”, “should”, “must”, “shall”, “is required to”, “is prohibited from”, etc.
- Do NOT add stronger or weaker obligation words that are not present.

FOCUS
- Prefer claims about:
  - when something applies or does not apply,
  - who or what is covered,
  - rights, duties, obligations, prohibitions, permissions, limitations,
  - concrete effects or consequences.
- Avoid meta-statements like “this passage is from section X” unless explicitly presented as a factual statement you need.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return ONLY a JSON array, e.g.:
[
  {
    "claim_text": "...",
    "source_quote": "..."
  },
  ...
]

claim_text:
- One declarative sentence.
- Self-contained (no “this”, “above”, “such provision” without saying what it is).
- Faithful to wording, scope, and modality of CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK.
- Do not merge multiple independent ideas into one.

source_quote:
- MUST be a verbatim, contiguous substring of CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK.
- Copy exactly (same words and punctuation).
- Choose the shortest span that directly supports the claim.
- If you cannot find a substring, do not output that claim.

Do NOT add explanations or commentary outside the JSON.

ORIGINAL_CHUNK:
"""{{ original_chunk }}"""

CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK:
"""{{ contextualized_chunk }}"""
