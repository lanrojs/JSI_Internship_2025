You are extracting atomic, factual claims from a passage of text.

You are given:
- CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK — a self-contained rewritten version of the passage.

TASK (REWRITE MODE)
- Identify factual or normative statements that are clearly expressed in the CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK.
- Convert each statement into a single, self-contained ATOMIC claim.

RULES:
- Every claim MUST be fully supported by the CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK alone.
- Preserve the modality exactly as written (“may”, “must”, “shall”, “is required to”, etc.).
- Do not strengthen or weaken obligations or permissions.

OUTPUT FORMAT  
Return ONLY a JSON array:
[
  {
    "claim_text": "...",
    "source_quote": "..."
  }
]

REQUIREMENTS
- “claim_text” must be:
  - one declarative sentence,
  - self-contained and unambiguous,
  - faithful to the meaning, scope, and modality of the CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK.
- “source_quote” must be:
  - a verbatim, contiguous substring of the CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK,
  - the most specific supporting span.

DO NOT
- Do not merge multiple independent ideas.
- Do not add explanations or commentary.
- Do not import any information not present in the CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK.

Return only the JSON array.

CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK:
"""{{ contextualized_chunk }}"""
