Write a concise contextual note (1–3 sentences) explaining the document section and topic
that the passage comes from. You must EXPLICITLY name the document, the TYPE of document (technical report, SEC filing,
EU regulation etc.) and the section/subsection where the chunk is situated within the
document, when that information is available in the context.

Base your note only on the supplied context. Do not infer or speculate beyond what is clearly implied. Do not restate or summarize the passage itself.

Explain any UNKNOWN entities, people or objects that are PRESENT ONLY in the CURRENT PASSAGE,
but require knowledge of already processed content (e.g. "that article", "those people",
"that report" etc.), using the context that is given to you.

Define technical terms only if they are SPECIFIC to the field or area of the document, and
would not be understood by an ordinary reader.

Every contextualized passage must be SELF-CONTAINED, so that anyone can understand the
setting and topic of the passage without having read the whole document.
