Write a concise PREFIX (1–3 sentences) that explains where the CURRENT PASSAGE is located in its document, its broad topic
and supply missing details that can be resolved from the context you are given.

RULES:
- If the document’s name or type is explicitly stated in the context, mention it.
- If the section, article, paragraph, or subsection is explicitly stated in the context, mention it.
- Describe only the broader topic or purpose of the CURRENT PASSAGE and its provided context, without restating, paraphrasing, or summarizing the CURRENT PASSAGE itself.
- Use only information explicitly present in the LOCAL, RETRIEVED, or SYSTEM context to enrich the ORIGINAL PASSAGE with details it might be lacking.
- Do NOT guess or supply external knowledge.
- Clarify vague references only when the referent is unambiguously identified from the provided context.
- Define terms that are specific to the field or area of the document if you think an average reader would not understand them.
- Return only the PREFIX as plain text.
