You are extracting atomic, factual claims from a passage of text.

You are given TWO related texts:
1) ORIGINAL_CHUNK: the authoritative source passage.
2) CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK: a contextualized or rewritten version that may help
   clarify references or provide additional background.

TASK (PREFIX MODE)
- Identify explicit factual or normative statements in the ORIGINAL_CHUNK.
- Rewrite each as a single, self-contained factual claim.

GROUNDING
- Every claim MUST be fully supported by the ORIGINAL_CHUNK.
- You may use the CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK only to:
  - clarify pronouns or vague references,
  - infer document section or actor names when clearly supported,
  - add minimal missing context wording without changing meaning.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Return a JSON array. Each element MUST be an object:
  {
    "claim_text":  "...",
    "source_quote": "..."
  }

REQUIREMENTS
- "claim_text" must be:
  - a single, declarative sentence,
  - free of vague references like "this", "above", "such provision",
  - faithful in scope and modality (do not strengthen or weaken language).
- "source_quote" must be:
  - a literal substring taken from the ORIGINAL_CHUNK,
  - the most specific span that directly supports the claim.

DO NOT
- Do not invent new facts or interpretive conclusions.
- Do not broaden or narrow the scope vs. the ORIGINAL_CHUNK.
- Do not combine multiple independent ideas into one claim.
- If a candidate claim is not clearly and fully supported by the ORIGINAL_CHUNK, skip it.

Return ONLY the JSON array, with no extra text.

ORIGINAL_CHUNK:
"""{{ original_chunk }}"""

CONTEXTUALIZED_CHUNK:
"""{{ contextualized_chunk }}"""
