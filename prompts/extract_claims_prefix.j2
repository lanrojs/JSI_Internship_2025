You are extracting atomic, factual claims from a passage of text.

You are given two inputs:
1) ORIGINAL_CHUNK — the authoritative source passage.
2) CONTEXT_PREFIX — a short contextual note that may clarify references or resolve ambiguity if needed.

TASK:
- Identify explicit factual or normative statements in the ORIGINAL_CHUNK.
- Rewrite each statement as a single, self-contained atomic claim.

RULES:
- Every claim MUST be fully supported by the ORIGINAL_CHUNK.
- You may use the CONTEXT_PREFIX only to:
  - resolve pronouns or vague references,
  - clarify which actor, entity, or section is being referred to,
  - supply minimal wording needed for disambiguation.
- You MUST NOT introduce any detail that appears only in the CONTEXT_PREFIX but not clearly supported by the ORIGINAL_CHUNK.

OUTPUT FORMAT  
Return ONLY a JSON array of objects:
[
  {
    "claim_text": "...",
    "source_quote": "..."
  }
]

REQUIREMENTS
- “claim_text” must be:
  - one declarative sentence,
  - self-contained (no “this”, “that provision”, “above”),
  - identical in meaning, scope, and modality to the ORIGINAL_CHUNK.
- “source_quote” must be:
  - a literal, contiguous substring of the ORIGINAL_CHUNK,
  - the shortest text span that directly supports the claim.

DO NOT
- Do not infer new facts.
- Do not broaden or narrow the meaning.
- Do not combine multiple independent statements.
- If a statement is not clearly supported by the ORIGINAL_CHUNK, skip it.

Return only the JSON array with no extra text.

ORIGINAL_CHUNK:
"""{{ original_chunk }}"""

CONTEXT_PREFIX:
"""{{ context_prefix }}"""
