You are a careful relevance filter.

Your task:
Given the QUERY PASSAGE below and a list of candidate context passages,
decide for each candidate whether it is relevant to understanding or
contextualizing the query passage.

For EACH candidate, you MUST output exactly one line in the following format:

<id>\t<yes_or_no>

where:
- <id> is the candidate id (exactly as given)
- <yes_or_no> is either "yes" or "no" (lowercase, no quotes)

Do NOT output anything else. No explanations, no extra text, no JSON.

Example of the REQUIRED format (for three candidates):

chunk_001    yes
chunk_002    no
chunk_003    yes

---------------- QUERY PASSAGE ----------------
{{ query_passage }}

---------------- CANDIDATES ----------------
{% for c in candidates %}
ID: {{ c.id }}
SOURCE: {{ c.kind }}
TEXT:
{{ c.text }}

----------------
{% endfor %}
